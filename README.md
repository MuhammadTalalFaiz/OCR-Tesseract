# Tesseract OCR & CV2 Reading Order Recovery of Documents
Sure, here's an example of a possible README file for the OCR project till now:

OCR Project
This project aims to develop an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that can read text from newspaper images.

Setup
To run the project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You also need to install some dependencies:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python-headless numpy
Usage
The OCR system consists of several steps:

Load the image and preprocess it (blur, threshold, etc.)
Detect line segments in the image
Sort the line segments based on their position on the page
Perform OCR on each line segment to extract the text
To run the entire OCR pipeline, you can use the ocr.py script:

Copy code
python ocr.py input_image.jpg
This will load the input_image.jpg file, apply the OCR pipeline, and output the recognized text to the console.

Current status
The OCR system is able to detect line segments in the image and sort them based on their position on the page. However, the OCR module is not yet implemented, so the output of the pipeline is just the bounding boxes of the line segments.

Future work
The next step in the project is to implement the OCR module to recognize the text within the line segments. This will involve training a machine learning model on a dataset of newspaper fonts, as well as implementing a character recognition algorithm.
